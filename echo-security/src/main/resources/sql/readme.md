This directory have some sql script for echo-security. You can execute them at mysql.
There are some naming rules for table, view, function, stored procedures. In echo
framework database object must be started with "EH". For example, "user_account" table
should be name as "EHT_USER_ACCOUNT"(echo table userAccount). And we should name view,
stored procedures started with "EHV" and "EHP". if table is a relative table, then we
should use "EHTR" named for its start.
